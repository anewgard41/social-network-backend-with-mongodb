# Social Network Backend Built with Mongoose 

## Description

Welcome to your future social network application's backend! This backend utilizes the mongoDB ODM Mongoose, as well as Express, and of course, Node. Using this backend, you will be able to create, delete, and update users, and add users to a friends list. You also have the ability to write and share your thoughts! Other users and friends can then add reactions to your thoughts. These thoughts can be updated and deleted as well. Again this is only the backend, but it should provide a robust foundation for your fun and colorful social media app!

## Up and Running 

To run this application you will need Node.js and access to mongoDB. After cloning this repository to your local, you simply just need to run `npm install` then `npm start` or `node server.js`. Viola! The backend is up and ready to go. 

After the server is up and running, you can access the backend and assess what data is given by the RESTful APIs endpoints. 

Here is a link to a walkthrough video of the application if you would like a visual:
